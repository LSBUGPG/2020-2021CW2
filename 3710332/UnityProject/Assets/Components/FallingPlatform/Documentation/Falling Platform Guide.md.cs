//// Falling Platform Guide

//This document is to explain what behaviours this package does and how to use them. This package will explain what is needed within the unity project for the behaviour to work properly when imported to your project

////What is used within package:
//    - Player(with PlayerController)
//    - Cube(platform)
//    - GameObject(Destination and Platfrom Destroyer)
//    - Plane(Ground)


//What is needed:
//    - Empty GameObject
//    - Platfrom
//    - Player Character
//    - 


//How the Falling Pltform Script works:

//This script will give the disable kinematic on the rb for the platform and drop the platform towards the empty GameObject once the player enters the trigger box of the platform.Once the platform enters the empty gameObject, the platform is then destroyed.
