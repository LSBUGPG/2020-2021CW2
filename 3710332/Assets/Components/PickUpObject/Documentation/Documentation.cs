//PickUpObject Guide

//This document is to explain how the package works and what is needed for it to work effieciently.

//What is used:

//    - Player(PlayerController)
//    - Any 3D object(PickUp)
//    - Ground

//How the script works:

//The PickUpObject script works by desrtroying the object once the player is within the trigger box of the pick up. Once the object is destroyed/picked up, iterator will print that the item has been picked up.
