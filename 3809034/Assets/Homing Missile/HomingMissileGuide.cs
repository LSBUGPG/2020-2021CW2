     This document explains what the behaviours in this package does and how it 
     can work effectively.

     # Homing Missile Script
     This script should be applied to an enemy, missile or bullet. There are two
     main ways to find the target, both are seen in the script. There are also
     two float which would need to be configured.

     - Speed - How fast the missle can go
     - Rotate Speed - How fast the missile can change direction.

     # Example Scene
     There is a box controlled by the player and there is a bullet that locks onto
     the play and gets destroyed when it touches the player
