/*
When creating the player object make sure that you have a line renderer as well as a rigidbody.
In the editor you have to assign :
	the gun tip ( point the hook is going to start from )
	Camera( the camera that is attached to the player)
	MaxDistance( the maximum distance at which the hook can be created)
	Player Object ( the main object of the player object)
	Player trans ( Trasform of the player)
You will also have to create a new layer or choose one of the existing ones with which the hook can interact with.
