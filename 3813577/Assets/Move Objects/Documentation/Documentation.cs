/*
In order to make this component work you only need to assign a couple of things
	Object hold is the position at which the the object is going to be held at when picked up ( you can create an empty object as a child of the player and move it to your liking )
	Distance is the maximum distance at which the player can pick up an object
	Camera is the main camera
	In RayMask you can choose which layers the script can interact with
