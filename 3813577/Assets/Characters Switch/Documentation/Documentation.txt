This script can be used to switch between 2 main players. The script works by enabling and disabling the input and camera on each of the game objects.
For the example scene, the code only enables and disables the camera and movement script, however multiple components can be disabled enabled using the format:
FirstPlayer/SecondPlayer.GetComponen<ComponentName>().enabled = false/true;
Make sure that you assign the references for the first and second player and the 2 cameras. Also make sure that first player and second player boxes are ticked in the inspector accordingly.
