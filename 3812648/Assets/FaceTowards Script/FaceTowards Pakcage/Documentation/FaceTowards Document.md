#FaceTowards Script Manual#

Drag the package into the assets window of your Unity Project and click import on the pop up window.

Drag the script onto the object that you wish to consistantly move towards the other object or in the object in the hiarchy.

Drage the moving object from the hiarchy into the "Object Focus" variable in the scripted object's inspector.

Note: Make sure the front of the object is the same as the blue arrow that you can see in transformation mode.
if the front of the object is different than the blue arrow, then the wrong side of the object will point toward the moving object.
