Player Movement and Double Jump Package - Manual

This package contains:
- A movement and jumping Script called "playerControls" 
- An example scene which demonstrates how the code will work with objects

To use this package, place the script on the object that is your player in the inspector.
Make sure your object has a rigidbody attached to it and any ground that the player will be standing on has the tag "Floor" attached to it.

This script will allow the player to be able to move in all directions and double jump in the air.

The float speed is how fast the player can move in all directions.
The Grounded Boolean detects whether the player is colliding with the ground or not (stops infinite jumping).
The constant interger called maxJumps sets the number of jumps that the player is allowed to do before touching the ground again.
The interger currentJumps sets the players number of jumps to 0 by default, allows the player to jump twice and then resets when colliding with the floor again.
